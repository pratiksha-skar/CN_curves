# Unveiling Arithmetic Statistics of Congruent Number Elliptic Curves via Data Science and Machine Learning

This repository contains the computational code accompanying the paper:

**"Unveiling Arithmetic Statistics of Congruent Number Elliptic Curves via Data Science and Machine Learning"**  
by *Priyavrat Deshpande, Aditya Karnataki, Pratiksha Shingavekar*, 2025.

The project explores arithmetic statistics of congruent number elliptic curves using tools from data science and machine learning.  
The repository contains SageMath notebooks for arithmetic computations and Python notebooks for statistical analysis and experiments.
